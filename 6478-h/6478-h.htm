      PREFACE
    </h3>
    <p class="first">
      Having accompanied Sir James Boss on his voyage of discovery to the
      Antarctic regions, where botany was my chief pursuit, on my return I
      earnestly desired to add to my acquaintance with the natural history of
      the temperate zones, more knowledge of that of the tropics than I bad
      hitherto had the opportunity of acquiring. My choice lay between India and
      the Andes, and I decided upon the former, being principally influenced by
      Dr. Falconer, who promised me every assistance which his position as
      Superintendent of the H.E.I.C. Botanic Garden at Calcutta, would enable
      hum to give. He also drew my attention to the fact that we were ignorant
      even of the geography of the central and eastern parts of these mountains,
      while all to the north was involved in a mystery equally attractive to the
      traveller and the naturalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing of the kind interest taken by Baron Humboldt in my proposed
      travels, and at the request of my father (Sir William Hooker), the Earl of
      Carlisle (then Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests) undertook to
      represent to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government

    <p class="first">
      the expediency of securing my collections for the Royal Gardens at Kew;
      and owing to the generous exertions of that nobleman, and of the late Earl
      of Auckland (then First Lord of the Admiralty), my journey assumed the
      character of a Government mission, &pound;400 per annum being granted by
      the Treasury for two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not contemplate proceeding beyond the Himalaya and Tibet, when Lord
      Auckland desired that I should afterwards visit Borneo, for the purpose of
      reporting on the capabilities of Labuan, with reference to the cultivation
      of cotton, tobacco, sugar, indigo, spices, guttapercha, etc. To this end a
      commission in the navy (to which service I was already attached) was given
      me, such instructions were drawn up as might facilitate my movements in
      the East, and a suitable sum of money was placed at my disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after leaving England, my plans became, from various causes, altered.
      The Earl of Auckland* was dead; the interest in Borneo had in a great
      measure subsided; H.M.S. &ldquo;M&aelig;ander,&rdquo; to which I had been
      attached for service in Labuan, had left the Archipelago; reports of the
      unhealthy nature of the coast had excited
    </p>
    <p class="fnote">
      * It is with a melancholy satisfaction that I here record the intentions
      of that enlightened nobleman. The idea of turning to public account what
      was intended as a scientific voyage, occurred to his lordship when
      considering my application for official leave to proceed to India; and
      from the hour of my accepting the Borneo commission with which he honoured
      me, he displayed the most active zeal in promoting its fulfilment. He
      communicated to me his views as to the direction in which I should pursue
      my researches, furnished me with official and other information, and
      provided me with introductions of the most essential use.

      alarm; and the results of my researches in the Himalaya had proved of more
      interest and advantage than had been anticipated. It was hence thought
      expedient to cancel the Borneo appointment, and to prolong my services for
      a third year in India; for which purpose a grant of &pound;300 (originally
      intended for defraying the expense of collecting only, in Borneo) was
      transferred as salary for the additional year to be spent in the Himalaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portion of the Himalaya best worth exploring, was selected for me both
      by Lord Auckland and Dr. Falconer, who independently recommended Sikkim,
      as being ground untrodden by traveller or naturalist. Its ruler was,
      moreover, all but a dependant of the British government, and it was
      supposed, would therefore be glad to facilitate my researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      No part of the snowy Himalaya eastward of the northwest extremity of the
      British possessions had been visited since Turner&rsquo;s embassy to Tibet
      in 1789; and hence it was highly important to explore scientifically a
      part of the chain which, from its central position, might be presumed to
      be typical of the whole range. The possibility of visiting Tibet, and of
      ascertaining particulars respecting the great mountain Chumulari,* which
      was only known from Turner&rsquo;s account, were additional inducements to
      a student of physical geography;
    </p>
    <p class="fnote">
      * My earliest recollections in reading are of &ldquo;Turner&rsquo;s
      Travels in Tibet,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s Voyages.&rdquo; The
      account of Lama worship and of Chumulari in the one, and of Kerguelen&rsquo;s
      Land in the other, always took a strong hold on my fancy. It is,
      therefore, singular that Kerguelen&rsquo;s Land should have been the first
      strange country I ever visited (now fourteen years ago), and that in the
      first King&rsquo;s ship which has touched there since Cook&rsquo;s voyage,
      and whilst following the track of that illustrious navigator in south
      polar discovery. At a later period I have been nearly the first European
      who has approached Chumulari since Turner&rsquo;s embassy.

      but it was not then known that Kinchinjunga, the loftiest known mountain
      on the globe, was situated on my route, and formed a principal feature in
      the physical geography of Sikkim.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passage to Egypt was provided by the Admiralty in H.M. steam-vessel
      &ldquo;Sidon,&rdquo; destined to convey the Marquis of Dalhousie,
      Governor-General of India, thus far on his way. On his arrival in Egypt,
      his Lordship did me the honour of desiring me to consider myself in the
      position of one of his suite, for the remainder of the voyage, which was
      performed in the &ldquo;Moozuffer,&rdquo; a steam frigate belonging to the
      Indian Navy. My obligations to this nobleman had commenced before leaving
      England, by his promising me every facility he could command; and he thus
      took the earliest opportunity of affording it, by giving me such a
      position near himself as ensured me the best reception everywhere; no
      other introduction being needed. His Lordship procured my admission into
      Sikkim, and honoured me throughout my travels with the kindest
      encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the passage out, some days were spent in Egypt, at Aden, Ceylon,
      and Madras. I have not thought it necessary to give here the observations
      made in those well-known countries; they are detailed in a series of
      letters published in the &ldquo;London Journal of Botany,&rdquo;

      as written for my private friends. Arriving at Calcutta in January, I
      passed the remainder of the cold season in making myself acquainted with
      the vegetation of the plains and hills of Western Bengal, south of the
      Ganges, by a journey across the mountains of Birbhoom and Behar to the
      Soane valley, and thence over the Vindhya range to the Ganges, at
      Mirzapore, whence I descended that stream to Bhaugulpore; and leaving my
      boat, struck north to the Sikkim Himalaya. This excursion is detailed in
      the &ldquo;London Journal of Botany,&rdquo; and the Asiatic Society of
      Bengal honoured me by printing the meteorological observations made during
      its progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the two years&rsquo; residence in Sikkim which succeeded, I was
      laid under obligations of no ordinary nature to Brian H. Hodgson, Esq.,
      B.C.S., for many years Resident at the Nepal Court; whose guest I became
      for several months. Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s high position as a man of science
      requires no mention here; but the difficulties he overcame, and the
      sacrifices he made, in attaining that position, are known to few. He
      entered the wilds of Nepal when very young, and in indifferent health; and
      finding time to spare, cast about for the best method of employing it: he
      had no one to recommend or direct a pursuit, no example to follow, no
      rival to equal or surpass; he had never been acquainted with a scientific
      man, and knew nothing of science except the name. The natural history of
      men and animals, in its most comprehensive sense, attracted his attention;
      he sent to Europe for books, and commenced the study of ethnology and

      zoology. His labours have now extended over upwards of twenty-five years&rsquo;
      residence in the Himalaya. During this period he has seldom had a staff of
      less than from ten to twenty persons (often many more), of various tongues
      and races, employed as translators and collectors, artists, shooters, and
      stuffers. By unceasing exertions and a princely liberality, Mr. Hodgson
      has unveiled the mysteries of the Boodhist religion, chronicled the
      affinities, languages, customs, and faiths of the Himalayan tribes; and
      completed a natural history of the animals and birds of these regions. His
      collections of specimens are immense, and are illustrated by drawings and
      descriptions taken from life, with remarks on the anatomy,* habits, and
      localities of the animals themselves. Twenty volumes of the Journals, and
      the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, teem with the proofs of his
      indefatigable zeal; and throughout the cabinets of the bird and quadruped
      departments of our national museum, Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s name stands
      pre-eminent. A seat in the Institute of France, and the cross of the
      Legion of Honour, prove the estimation in which his Boodhist studies are
      held on the continent of Europe. To be welcomed to the Himalaya by such a
      person, and to be allowed the most unreserved intercourse, and the
      advantage of all his information and library, exercised a material
      influence on the progress I made in my studies, and on my travels. When I
      add that many of the subjects

      treated of in these volumes were discussed between us, it will be evident
      that it is impossible for me to divest much of the information thus
      insensibly obtained, of the appearance of being the fruits of my own
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Campbell, the Superintendent of Dorjiling, is likewise the
      Governor-General&rsquo;s agent, or medium of communication between the
      British Government and the Sikkim Rajah; and as such, invested with many
      discretionary powers. In the course of this narrative, I shall give a
      sketch of the rise, progress, and prospects of the Sanatarium, or
      Health-station of Dorjiling, and of the anomalous position held by the
      Sikkim Rajah. The latter circumstance led indirectly to the detention of
      Dr. Campbell (who joined me in one of my journeys) and myself, by a
      faction of the Sikkim court, for the purpose of obtaining from the Indian
      Government a more favourable treaty than that then existing. This mode of
      enforcing a request by <i>douce violence</i> and detention, is common with
      the turbulent tribes east of Nepal, but was in this instance aggravated by
      violence towards my fellow-prisoner, through the ill will of the persons
      who executed the orders of their superiors, and who had been punished by
      Dr. Campbell for crimes committed against both the British and Nepalese
      governments. The circumstances of this outrage were misunderstood at the
      time; its instigators were supposed to be Chinese; its perpetrators
      Tibetans; and we the offenders were assumed to have thrust ourselves into
      the country, without authority from our own government,

      and contrary to the will of the Sikkim Rajah; who was imagined to be a
      tributary of China, and protected by that nation, and to be under no
      obligation to the East Indian government.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the obligations I owe to Dr. Campbell, I confine myself to
      saying that his whole aim was to promote my comfort, and to secure my
      success, in all possible ways. Every object I had in view was as
      sedulously cared for by him as by myself: I am indebted to his influence
      with Jung Bahadoor* for the permission to traverse his dominions, and to
      visit the Tibetan passes of Nepal. His prudence and patience in
      negotiating with the Sikkim court, enabled me to pursue my investigations
      in that country. My journal is largely indebted to his varied and
      extensive knowledge of the people and productions of these regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all numerical calculations connected with my observations, I received
      most essential aid from John Muller, Esq., Accountant of the Calcutta
      Mint, and from his brother, Charles Muller, Esq., of Patna, both ardent
      amateurs in scientific pursuits, and who employed themselves in making
      meteorological observations at Dorjiling, where they were recruiting
      constitutions impaired by the performance of arduous duties in the climate
      of the plains. I cannot sufficiently thank these gentlemen for

    <p class="fnote">
      * It was in Nepal that Dr. Campbell gained the friendship of Jung
      Bahadoor, the most remarkable proof of which is the acceding to his
      request, and granting me leave to visit the eastern parts of his
      dominions; no European that I am aware of, having been allowed, either
      before or since, to travel anywhere except to and from the plains of India
      and valley of Katmandu, in which the capital city and British residency
      are situated.

      the handsome manner in which they volunteered me their assistance in these
      laborious operations. Mr. J. Muller resided at Dorjiling during eighteen
      months of my stay in Sikkim, over the whole of which period his generous
      zeal in my service never relaxed; he assisted me in the reduction of many
      hundreds of my observations for latitude, time, and elevation, besides
      adjusting and rating my instruments; and I can recall no more pleasant
      days than those thus spent with these hospitable friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to Dr. Falconer&rsquo;s indefatigable exertions, such of my
      collections as reached Calcutta were forwarded to England in excellent
      order; and they were temporarily deposited in Kew Gardens until their
      destination should be determined. On my return home, my scientific friends
      interested themselves in procuring from the Government such aid as might
      enable me to devote the necessary time to the arrangement, naming, and
      distributing of my collections, the publication of my manuscripts, etc. I
      am in this most deeply indebted to the disinterested and generous
      exertions of Mr. L. Horner, Sir Charles Lyell, Dr. Lindley, Professor E.
      Forbes, and many others; and most especially to the Presidents of the
      Royal Society (the Earl of Rosse), of the Linnean (Mr. R. Brown), and
      Geological (Mr. Hopkins), who in their official capacities memorialized in
      person the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests on this subject; Sir
      William Hooker at the same time bringing it under the notice of the First
      Lord of the Treasury.

      The result was a grant of &pound;400 annually for three years.

      Dr. T. Thomson joined me in Dorjiling in the end of 1849, after the
      completion of his arduous journeys in the North-West Himalaya and Tibet,
      and we spent the year 1850 in travelling and collecting, returning to
      England together in 1851. Having obtained permission from the Indian
      Government to distribute his botanical collections, which equal my own in
      extent and value, we were advised by all our botanical friends to
      incorporate, and thus to distribute them. The whole constitute an
      Herbarium of from 6000 to 7000 species of Indian plants, including an
      immense number of duplicates; and it is now in process of being arranged
      and named, by Dr. Thomson and myself, preparatory to its distribution
      amongst sixty of the principal public and private herbaria in Europe,
      India, and the United States of America.

    <p>
      For the information of future travellers, I may state that the total
      expense of my Indian journey, including outfit, three years and a half
      travelling, and the sending of my collections to Calcutta, was under
      &pound;2000 (of which &pound;1200 were defrayed by government), but would
      have come to much more, had I not enjoyed the great advantages I have
      detailed. This sum does not include the purchase of books and instruments,
      with which I supplied myself, and which cost about &pound;200, nor the
      freight of the collections to England, which was paid by Government. Owing
      to the kind services of Mr. J. C. Melvill, Secretary of the India House,

      small parcels of seeds, etc., were conveyed to England, free of cost; and
      I have to record my great obligations and sincere thanks to the Peninsular
      and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, for conveying, without charge, all
      small parcels of books, instruments and specimens, addressed to or by
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains to say something of the illustrations of this work. The maps
      are from surveys of my own, made chiefly with my own instruments, but
      partly with some valuable ones for the use of which I am indebted to my
      friend Captain H. Thuillier, Deputy Surveyor-General of India, who placed
      at my disposal the resources of the magnificent establishment under his
      control, and to whose innumerable good offices I am very greatly beholden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscapes, etc. have been prepared chiefly from my own drawings, and
      will, I hope, be found to be tolerably faithful representations of the
      scenes. I have always endeavoured to overcome that tendency to exaggerate
      heights, and increase the angle of slopes, which is I believe the
      besetting sin, not of amateurs only, but of our most accomplished artists.
      As, however, I did not use instruments in projecting the outlines, I do
      not pretend to have wholly avoided this snare; nor, I regret to say; has

      of such subjects is, and how unanimous artists seem to be as to the
      propriety of exaggerating those features which should predominate in the
      landscape, it may fairly be doubted whether the total effect of steepness
      and elevation, especially in a mountain view, can, on a small scale, be
      conveyed by a strict adherence to truth. I need hardly add, that if such
      is attainable, it is only by those who have a power of colouring that few
      pretend to. In the list of plates and woodcuts I have mentioned the
      obligations I am under to several friends for the use of drawings, etc.

      throughout, I am indebted to my fellow-traveller, Dr. Thomas Thomson.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
